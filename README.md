## how to use application

Ensure that node has been installed (needed to install npm packages)
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In the project directory run the following commands:

### `yarn`

to pull in the project dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `notes`

The google map api key(I dont want to be charged) has not been used so errors + water markers will be shown.

The position of ISS is polled once every 5.5 seconds (roughly the value recommend by the API), so try leaving the app running for a little while to see multiple markers

The application was tested using chrome
